:mod:`graphicalboard` module

:author: `FIL - IEEA - Univ. Lille1.fr <http://portail.fil.univ-lille1.fr>`_

:date:  2015, september, last revision: 2017, september

This module implements some functions to draw a minesweeper game. The
graphical board uses buttons to draw each cell and maps the left-click
and right-click events to interact with the minesweeper.

This module uses from :mod:`minesweeper`:

* :method:`Minesweeper.get_width`
* :method:`Minesweeper.get_height`
* :method:`Minesweeper.get_cell`
* :method:`Minesweeper.reveal_all_cells_from`
* :method:`Minesweeper.get_state`

and from :mod:`cell`
* :method:`Cell.set_hypothetic`
* :method:`Cell.unset_hypothetic`
* :method:`Cell.is_bomb`
* :method:`Cell.is_hypothetic_bomb`
* :method:`Cell.is_revealed`

To draw and run a minesweeper game, one has to:

* create a minesweeper game g
* create a graphical board from the minesweeper g
